  <h1>Just messing around with some stuff</h1>
  <p class="lead">Playing with some Angular.js, some heroku, some bootstrap, and <strike>tornado</strike> flask.</p>
  <p>The idea here is to build some sort of web application using tools that I am not (overly) familiar with, just as a way to exercise the ol' grey-matter. I don't know what I'll do yet, I doubt it will be very useful to the world at large, but it's going to be something.  Why is this called <span class="text-danger"><b>Genetic-Endgame</b></span>? Because Heroku can randomly give your project a name for you - after clicking through a few random names, I saw one with the word <b>genetic</b> and another with the word <b>endgame</b>. So, <span class="text-danger"><b>Genetic-Endgame</b></span> was born!</p>

      <h3>Angular.js</h3>
      <p>Creates <em>single page</em> javascript applications?  This page is magically loaded by javascript! It's a rediculously complicated way to load just a simple page like this, but interesting to learn.</p>

      <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
      <p>I don't really <em>do</em> design, so the bootstrap library does all the fancy things I think I want. Responsive design, nice typography, some fancy widgets when necessary.</p>

      <h3>Heroku</h3>
      <p>Being cheap, I don't want to spend a whole lot of money to host a site I'm just playing around with, but being mostly a server-side developer, I want to be able to play with relational databases, NoSQL databases, and server-side APIs. Heroku is a crazy way to do all that for free (with limitations)</p>

      <h3>Flask</h3>
      <p>After using Python based web-frameworks for <em>a decade</em> now, python feels like home. That being said, I've grown complacent with Pylons/Pyramid, and want to try something different. So I've looked to Tornado - which uses asynchronous networking and other cool stuff. After a lot of research, I don't think I need asynchronous features, so down with tornado! <b>Flask</b> is where it's at now. Small, I can add the stuff I want (mako, sqlalchemy, and so on).</p>

    <h5>Open Source <small>for what it's worth</small></h5>
    <p>Not like anyone will care, but this whole thing is open source. I'm not doing anything terribly valuable here, just piecing together things other people have written and having fun. It's all on <a href="https://github.com/brentodd/genetic-endgame">my GitHub</a>.</p>
