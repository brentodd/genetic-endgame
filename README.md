# genetic-endgame

###### Just messing around with some stuff
Playing with some Angular.js, some heroku, some bootstrap, and tornado.

The idea here is to build some sort of web application using tools that I am not (*overly*) familiar with, just as a way to exercise the ol' grey-matter. I don't know what I'll do yet, I doubt it will be very useful to the world at large, but it's going to be something. Why is this called **Genetic-Endgame**? Because Heroku can randomly give your project a name for you - after clicking through a few random names, I saw one with the word *genetic* and another with the word *endgame*. So, **Genetic-Endgame** was born!

### Angular.js
Creates single page javascript applications, I guess. This page is magically loaded by javascript! It's a rediculously complicated way to load just a simple page like this, but interesting to learn.

### Bootstrap
I don't really *do* design, so the bootstrap library does all the fancy things I think I want. Responsive design, nice typography, some fancy widgets when necessary.

### Heroku
Being cheap, I don't want to spend a whole lot of money to host a site I'm just playing around with, but being mostly a server-side developer, I want to be able to play with relational databases, NoSQL databases, and server-side APIs. Heroku is a crazy way to do all that for free (with limitations)

### Flask
After using Python based web-frameworks for *a decade* now, python feels like home. That being said, I've grown complacent with Pylons/Pyramid, and want to try something different. So I've looked to Tornado - which uses asynchronous networking and other cool stuff. After a lot of research, I don't think I need asynchronous features, so down with tornado! **Flask** is where it's at now. Small, I can add the stuff I want (mako, sqlalchemy, and so on).
